# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction Dashboard & System

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** developed as a **Final Year Project (FYP)**.  
It combines **machine learning prediction**, **health analysis**, and **interactive visualization** to help identify the risk of heart disease.

The system not only predicts heart disease but also provides:
- **Heart ratio analysis**
- **Personalized health recommendations**
- **Interactive Power BI dashboard** for insights

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning models  
- Analyze patient medical data to identify risk factors  
- Calculate **heart ratio** for improved risk assessment  
- Provide **health recommendations** based on prediction results  
- Visualize data trends using an interactive dashboard  

---

## 🧠 Features
- ✅ Heart disease prediction (Yes / No)
- ✅ Heart ratio calculation
- ✅ Personalized health recommendations
- ✅ Machine learning–based decision making
- ✅ Interactive Power BI dashboard
- ✅ Easy-to-use interface

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Linear Regression (Binary Classification)**

The models are trained on the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** and saved using `joblib` for reuse.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

| Metric | Description | Value |
|------|------------|------|
| Patients with Heart Disease | Diagnosed individuals | **508** |
| Patients without Heart Disease | Healthy individuals | **410** |
| Total Records | Dataset size | **918** |

## 📈 Visual Insights
- **Age Distribution:** Highest heart disease cases between 50–60 years  
- **MaxHR Analysis:** Healthy individuals show higher MaxHR  
- **Chest Pain Types:** ASY type is most common in heart disease patients  
- **Gender Analysis:** Males have higher heart disease occurrence  
- **Cholesterol Trends:** Slight variations between healthy and affected patients

## 🩸 Heart Ratio & Recommendations
- Heart ratio is calculated to enhance prediction reliability  
- Based on results, the system provides:
  - Lifestyle improvement suggestions
  - Diet and exercise recommendations
  - Health awareness guidance

---

## ⚙️ Filters (Dashboard)
- Chest Pain Type  
- Gender  
- ST_Slope  
- Age  

These filters allow dynamic exploration of patient data.
